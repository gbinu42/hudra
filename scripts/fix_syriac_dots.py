Normalize mis-encoded Syriac consonant dots in the prayer/psalm corpus.

East Syriac Madnhaya — common corpus confusions:
  1. U+073C HBASA-ESASA DOTTED on BGDKPT → U+0742 RUKKAKHA
     (on other letters U+073C is the legitimate /i/ vowel — keep)
  2. U+073F RWAHA on BGDKPT → U+0741 QUSHSHAYA
     (on other letters U+073F is the legitimate /o/ vowel — keep)

Generic combining dots → Syriac marks when the base letter fits:
  3. U+0323 COMBINING DOT BELOW on BGDKPT → U+0742 RUKKAKHA
  4. U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE on BGDKPT → U+0741 QUSHSHAYA.
     Overreach on the active participle is undone by 4b below.
  4b. Active-participle reading point: in the CaCeC participle the dot over
     the middle radical is a grammatical point, not qushshaya, and the radical
     is post-vocalic (soft). It is detected as a BGDKPT letter that carries a
     vowel of its own and follows a letter pointed with zqapha, and is written
     as U+0307. Gemination and hard positions have no preceding zqapha, so
     they keep qushshaya. The shape also fits a post-vocalic BGDKPT in a
     non-participle (ܥܒ݂ܵܕܹܿܝܗ̇), where the dot is more likely a mis-encoded
     syame; U+0307 is still the safe outcome there, since the letter is soft
     either way.
  5. U+0324 COMBINING DIAERESIS BELOW on ܬ → U+0740 FEMININE DOT
  5b. U+0331 COMBINING MACRON BELOW is removed.
     In this corpus the underline is noise (not a silent-letter mṭalqānā).
     U+0304 / U+0654 still become U+0747 via the bilingual-peshitta wrapper;
     U+0748 SYRIAC OBLIQUE LINE BELOW (mhaggyānā) is never produced here.

Soft pe (East Syriac convention) — narrowed to specific lexemes:
  6. (off) Blanket U+0742 on ܦ → U+032E COMBINING BREVE BELOW.
     Which of the two a soft pe takes depends on where it sits. Counting every
     marked pe in the hudra prayers: a pe that closes a syllable — no vowel of
     its own, a consonant behind it — is written with the breve 72,438 times
     and with rukkakha never; a pe carrying its own vowel (ܢܵܦ݂ܸܠ) or standing
     word-final (ܢܩܸܦ݂) keeps rukkakha. A blanket rule ignores that split, so
     it stays off.
  6b. The lexemes in BREVE_PE_LEXEMES take the breve: ܢܦ݂ܫ → ܢܦ̮ܫ, in every
     inflection and with any proclitic (ܢܲܦ̮ܫܹܗ, ܒܢܲܦ̮ܫܗܘܿܢ, ܠܢܲܦ̮ܫܟ݂ܘܿܢ),
     except where the pe is word-final. Within a listed lexeme the breve is
     kept even on a vocalised pe, since the corpus writes ܬܲܟܼܫ̈ܦ̮ܵܬܲܢ that way
     1,066 times. Only an existing rukkakha is rewritten; an unmarked pe is
     never given a mark the source did not write.

Mark order is normalized to letter–syame–vowel (e.g. ܪ̈ܲ).

Dotless rish (U+0716 ܖ) is a keyboard stand-in for resh with syame.
  It becomes U+072A ܪ, keeping syame. A dummy ܖ immediately before a
  real ܪ (ܦܲܓ݂ܖܪ̈) is dropped so the existing ܦܲܓ݂ܪܪ̈ collapse can fire.

Stacked vowels — a letter cannot carry two of them:
  7. A below vowel under a real /a/ or /ā/ (U+0732, U+0735) is a
     mis-encoded lower reading mark. Which mark depends on the vowel:
       U+073C HBASA → U+0323 COMBINING DOT BELOW (ܗ̄ܘܼܵܘ → ܗ̄ܘ̣ܵܘ)
       U+0738 / U+0739 ZLAMA → U+0324 COMBINING DIAERESIS BELOW
         (ܗܘܸܵܬ݂ → ܗܘ̤ܵܬ݂). NFC stores the marks as ܘ̣ܵ / ܘ̤ܵ.
     Yodh is exempt: ܝܼܵ is a genuine mater plus the following vowel
     (ܢܒ݂ܝܼܵܐ, ܐܹܠܝܼܵܐ), not a stacked pair.

Serto vowel signs left in a Madnhaya text:
  7b. U+0736 RBASA ABOVE → U+0738 DOTTED ZLAMA HORIZONTAL and
     U+073A HBASA ABOVE → U+0739 DOTTED ZLAMA ANGULAR, in place.
     U+073D ESASA ABOVE marks /u/ on the consonant before the waw; it moves
     onto the waw as U+073C (ܨܽܘܪ → ܨܘܼܪ). A waw that already carries
     a vowel keeps it and the Serto mark is absorbed, not duplicated.

"From" particle ܡ̣ܢ (applied when the text tradition uses this pointing):
  8. Bare particle ܡܢ / wrong ܡ݂ܢ, ܡܼܢ, ܡܢ݂ → ܡ̣ܢ (U+0323 DOT BELOW).
     Any one-dot-below shape counts, on either letter: the point belongs
     between them, so it lands on the mim or the nun depending on the source.
     Zlama form ܡܸܢ → ܡ̣ܢ, standalone particle only.
     Mirror case for "who": ܡ݁ܢ / ܡܢ݁ → ܡ̇ܢ (U+0307 DOT ABOVE), where
     qushshaya was typed for the supralinear point.
     Proclitics ܘ / ܕ kept: ܘܡ̣ܢ, ܕܡ̣ܢ.
     Only the standalone particle is pointed: ܡܢ inside a word
     (ܡܢܵܐ, ܡܢܵܬ݂ܵܐ, ܥܲܡܢ) is left alone, so the word boundary has to
     treat vowel points and other combining marks as word-internal.
     Do NOT touch already-pointed ܡܲܢ / ܡ̇ܢ / ܡܵܢ / ܡܼܢ,
     ܡܸܢ inside other roots (ܗܲܝܡܸܢ), or suffixed ܡܸܢܝ / ܡܸܢܹܗ / ܡܸܢܗܘܿܢ.
     Interrogative/relative "who" with ܠ or ܒ: ܠܡܢ → ܠܡܲܢ, ܒܡܢ → ܒܡܲܢ.

Never delete diacritics: if no remapping rule applies, the mark is kept.
When soft + hard end up on the same letter, keep soft and drop qushshaya.
